- [x] Load a list in a RecyclerVIew/ListView/GridView with the help of adapter.
- [x] Add SwipeRefreshLayout so we can pull down to refresh the news list.
- [x] Query all the sources from api, and select with sources to be shown in a setting page.
- [x] Preserve the page selection using SharedPreference and database.
- [x] Use gradle to protect our API key and get build time.
- [x] Dynamically change the menu, depending on the module we are in.
- [x] Add a attribution page to thank the API providers and open-source libraries.
