    <p>Departify is an app to transform photos into paintings, using the service from <a href="https://www.deeparteffects.com">Deep Art Effects</a></p>
    <p>This app was born as a demonstration of some Android capabilities (RecyclerView, Palette, etc), and gradually grew into a worshiper of Deep Art Effects service, since I'm so attracted by the charming art styles they provided.</p>
    <p>I'm subscribing on their {departify_sub_type} plan which has a few limitations on using their API, thus the daily quota in this app is limited to {departify_quota} and the service from this app can be unreliable or even unusable. But I suppose they will be happy for you to <a href="https://developer.deeparteffects.com">register</a> as their developer and I also offer the possibility to use your own credentials in this app. By clicking <a href="departify://enter-user-credentials">here</a> you will be prompted to enter the credentials, which will then be kept locally on your device and only used to test their service. I have the code open-sourced on <a href="https://github.com/zjn0505/Neu-Android/tree/master/departify">GitHub</a>, feel free to use it, and I am appreciated for any suggestions.</p>
